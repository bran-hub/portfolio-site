# About Me
My name is Brandon Hubah and I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2018 with a B.A. in Honours Economics, Specialization in Finance. I enrolled in the co-operative education program at uWaterloo which helped me to get valuable work experience before I graduated. My experiences range across different types of asset managers; mutual fund, insurance fund and hedge fund. I guess now you might understand why I am interested in learning Python for finance. Through my experiences, I witnessed first hand how traditional investment analysis is being outdated due to the availability of market data. I needed to learn how to leverage more powerful tools to keep up with the proliferation of financial data. Hence, my journey into using Python for finance.
